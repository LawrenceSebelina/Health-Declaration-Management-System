                            <p class="text-justify">The Perpetual Help Medical Center- Binan was founded over 40 years ago. Its humble beginnings date back to the 1950s as a small lying-in clinic along V. Concepcion Street in Manila, put up by Drs. Jose G. Tamayo and Josefina “Nena” Laperal Tamayo, an Obstetrician-Gynecologist and Pediatrician, respectively. Their first patients were often the less fortunate and would pay for the services rendered to them in kind such as livestock, vegetables, fruits and the like. Though it started as a small 2-storey hospital in Sampaloc, Manila, it has grown over the years, to a 4 building complex.</p>
                            <p class="text-justify">It is now the only Level 3, teaching/ training hospital in Laguna with an approved 250 bed capacity. This allows us to provide medical care for our patients 24/7. Our growing healthcare team with a wide availability of specialties gives our patients peace of mind that each aspect of his/her healthcare is covered.</p>
                            <p class="text-justify">The hospital was set up as a nonstock nonprofit foundation to serve the health needs of its neighboring communities. It is Philhealth accredited and has over 29 affiliated HMOS and 11 insurance companies making availing of our healthcare services more accessible.</p>
                            <p class="text-justify">The PHMC-B has continually improving its medical technologies and facilities to be able to cater to the growing health needs of the population. Congruently its staff capabilities are constantly trained to ensure the delivery of holistic and efficient patient care.</p>
